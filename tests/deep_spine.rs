//! Regression test: a crafted proof encoding a deep left spine must not drive
//! label computation to the packed depth.
//!
//! `Node::label` used to recurse into both children, so the recursion depth was
//! the depth of the tree — and a verifier's tree is materialised from proof
//! bytes. `reconstruct_tree` evaluates `label(&root)` *before* comparing it
//! against the starting digest, so the attacker needs no valid digest at all:
//! any 33 bytes reach the traversal. The result was a stack overflow, which
//! aborts the process rather than raising a catchable panic.
//!
//! The work runs on a worker with an explicit stack size, so the test measures
//! the implementation rather than the platform's default thread stack — an
//! earlier version keyed off the default and passed at 2 MiB while aborting at
//! 512 KiB.
//!
//! Both bounds below are measured, not guessed:
//!
//! * the recursive `label` exhausted this worker at roughly depth 700, so 2,000
//!   fails loudly if the iterative walk regresses (verified by reverting it);
//! * tearing the `Rc` chain down is still recursive and exhausts this worker at
//!   roughly depth 5,000, so 2,000 stays clear of a limit this test is not
//!   about.
//!
//! A regression aborts the process rather than failing the assertion — that is
//! inherent to testing stack exhaustion, and the abort is the signal.
